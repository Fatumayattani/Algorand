- **Founding and Vision**: 
  - Founded by Silvio Micali, a Turing award winner and cryptography expert.
  - Vision: Democratize finance and fulfill blockchain promise.

- **Consensus Protocol (Pure Proof of Stake - PPoS)**:
  - Addresses blockchain trilemma: security, scalability, decentralization.
  - Selects block proposer and voting committees per round.
  - Utilizes cryptographic algorithms like verifiable random functions and cryptographic sortition.

- **Proof-of-Stake vs Proof-of-Work**:
  - Proof-of-Stake: Users with more stake have more influence.
  - Proof-of-Work: Nodes race to solve cryptographic puzzles (mining).
  - Algorand's PPoS requires less energy than proof-of-work.

- **Native Currency (Algo)**:
  - Incentivizes network participation and serves as utility token.
  - Used for transaction fees and minimum balance deposits.

- **Fees**:
  - Calculated based on transaction size.
  - Option to augment fee for priority.
  - No gas fees; minimum fee is 1,000 microAlgos or 0.001 Algos.

- **Openness and Decentralization**:
  - Open and permissionless.
  - Anyone worldwide holding Algos can participate.
  - Nodes exist globally, ensuring decentralization.

- **Transparency and Forking**:
  - Code for core protocol is open source.
  - Forking is impossible due to PPoS and voting validation.

- **Performance**:
  - Blocks produced every 3.3 seconds.
  - Up to 25,000 transactions per block.
  - Throughput: approximately 7,500 transactions per second.

- **Finality**:
  - Transactions final as soon as confirmed in a block.
  - No delay in finality due to forking.

- **Core Features**:
  - Easy tokenization, transfer, and programming of value instruments.
  - Creation of fungible and non-fungible tokens with single transactions.
  - Sophisticated dApps with Algorand smart contracts.

- **Developer Tools**:
  - Smart contracts written in Python.
  - SDKs available in Python, JavaScript, Golang, Java.

- **Team & Ecosystem**:
  - Open-source protocol with active development.
  - Strong ecosystem with top researchers and developers.
  - Investment in governance and ecosystem growth by Algorand Foundation.

- **Governance**:
  - Algorand Foundation governs network.
  - Commitment to decentralization and community involvement.
