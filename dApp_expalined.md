- **Definition of dApp**:
  - Decentralized Applications (dApps) run on decentralized computing systems like blockchains.

- **Scenario: Payment Application**:
  - Simple dApp example where users exchange assets with on-chain logic.

- **Complex Scenario: Auction Bidding**:
  - Challenge: Implementing bidding securely on-chain.
  - Traditional centralized approach lacks transparency and security.
  - Need for on-chain implementation to fulfill blockchain promise.

- **Role of Smart Contracts**:
  - On-chain logic programs enabling customized transfer conditions.
  - Composable with other layer-1 features (e.g., Algos, NFTs, fungible tokens).
  - Example: Using smart contracts for secure auction bidding.
  - Smart contracts provide transparency, immutability, and verifiability.

- **Benefits of Smart Contracts**:
  - Transition from trusting entities to trusting code.
  - Code openness ensures predictability and eliminates single points of failure.
  - Users can verify smart contract behavior independently.

- **Importance of Security**:
  - Smart contract code must undergo rigorous review and security audits.
  - Poorly written code can compromise security and trust.

- **Programming Languages for Smart Contracts**:
  - Python with the PyTeal library is supported on Algorand for writing smart contracts.
